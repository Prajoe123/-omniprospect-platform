## LinkedIn Compliance Guidelines

## Best Practices for Implementation

### Rate Limiting and Delays
```javascript
// Example: LinkedIn scraping with delays
const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

async function scrapeLinkedInProfile(url) {
  // Random delay between 2-5 seconds
  await delay(Math.random() * 3000 + 2000);
  
  // Implement scraping logic here
  // Check for rate limiting responses
  // Handle errors gracefully
}
```

### Proxy and User Agent Management
- Rotate user agents to appear as different browsers
- Use residential proxies for larger operations
- Monitor IP reputation and rotate as needed
- Implement retry logic for failed requests

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- Log all scraping activities
- Monitor for unusual patterns or blocks
- Implement circuit breakers for repeated failures
- Alert administrators of compliance issues
