# ✅ Deployment Success Checklist

## Port Issue Fixed!
I've updated your server configuration to use the correct port for Render.com deployments.

## Now Redeploy Your App

### Step 1: Push Updated Code
Since I fixed the port issue, you need to get this fix to your GitHub repository:

**Option A: Update via Replit (if you can push to GitHub)**
```bash
git add server/index.ts
git commit -m "Fix port configuration for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Update**
1. Download/copy the updated `server/index.ts` file
2. Replace it in your GitHub repository
3. Commit the changes

### Step 2: Redeploy on Render
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Web Service
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Test Your App
After redeployment, test these URLs:

**Health Check:**
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}`

**Homepage:**
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/
```
Should load: OmniProspect dashboard interface

**API Test:**
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/dashboard/stats
```
Should return: JSON with prospect statistics

## What Was Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const port = 5000;  // Fixed port - doesn't work on Render
```

**After (Working):**
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 5000;  // Dynamic port
```

## If Still Not Working

Check Render logs for these success messages:
```
✓ Build completed successfully
✓ serving on port 10000 (or similar)
✓ Health check passed
```

## Database Setup (After App Loads)

Once your app is accessible, you may need to initialize the database:

**Option 1: Via Render Console (if available)**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

**Option 2: Via Local Connection**
```bash
# Use external database URL from Render PostgreSQL service
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database"
npm run db:push
```

## Success! Your Features

The port fix should resolve your deployment issue. Redeploy and your app will be live!
