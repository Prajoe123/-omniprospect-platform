# GitHub Repository Upload Checklist

## Missing Files Issue
Your GitHub repository is missing the complete OmniProspect project structure. Here's what needs to be uploaded:

## Required Folder Structure

```

## Solution: Complete Upload

### Method 1: Download & Upload All Files (Recommended)

**Step 1: Download from Replit**
1. Click the menu (⋮) in your Replit project
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. Extract the zip file

**Step 2: Upload to GitHub**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Delete existing files (if any)
3. Upload ALL extracted files and folders
4. Ensure folder structure matches above

### Method 2: Manual File Creation

Create each missing folder and file in GitHub:

**1. Create server/index.ts:**
- Click "Create new file" in GitHub
- Name: `server/index.ts`
- Paste the content from the updated file

**2. Create other server files:**
- `server/routes.ts`
- `server/storage.ts` 
- `server/vite.ts`

**3. Create client folder structure:**
- Upload entire client/ folder from Replit

**4. Create shared folder:**
- `shared/schema.ts`
- `shared/advanced-search-schema.ts`

## Critical Files for Render Deployment

**Must have these for successful deployment:**

1. **package.json** - Contains build scripts and dependencies
2. **server/index.ts** - Updated with port fix
3. **client/** folder - React frontend
4. **render.yaml** - Deployment configuration
5. **vite.config.ts** - Build configuration

## Verification

After uploading, your repository should show:
- ✅ client/ folder with React files
- ✅ server/ folder with Node.js files  
- ✅ shared/ folder with TypeScript schemas
- ✅ Configuration files in root
- ✅ render.yaml for deployment

## Quick Test

Once all files are uploaded:
1. Redeploy on Render: "Deploy latest commit"
2. Check build logs for successful compilation
3. Test app URL: should load OmniProspect interface

The issue is that only some files were uploaded to GitHub, but the complete project structure is needed for deployment.
